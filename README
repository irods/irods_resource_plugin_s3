iRODS S3 Resource Plugin
------------------------

To build the S3 Resource Plugin, you will need to have:

 - the iRODS Development Tools (irods-dev and irods-runtime) installed for your platform
     http://irods.org/download

 - libxml2-dev / libxml2-devel

 - libcurl-dev / curl-devel

 - libs3 installed for your platform
     https://github.com/irods/libs3


Then to build this resource plugin:

  ./packaging/build.sh


To use this resource plugin:

  irods@hostname $ iadmin mkresc compResc compound
  irods@hostname $ iadmin mkresc cacheResc unixfilesystem <hostname>:</full/path/to/Vault>
  irods@hostname $ iadmin mkresc archiveResc s3 <hostname>:/<s3BucketName>/irods/Vault "S3_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME=s3.amazonaws.com;S3_AUTH_FILE=</full/path/to/AWS.keypair>;S3_RETRY_COUNT=<num reconn tries>;S3_WAIT_TIME_SEC=<wait between retries>;S3_PROTO=HTTP"
  irods@hostname $ iadmin addchildtoresc compResc cacheResc cache
  irods@hostname $ iadmin addchildtoresc compResc archiveResc archive
  irods@hostname $ iput -R compResc foo.txt

The AWS/S3 keypair file should have two values (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key):

  AKDJFH4KJHFCIOBJ5SLK
  rlgjolivb7293r928vu98n498ur92jfgsdkjfh8e

You may specify more than one host:IP as the S3_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME by listing them with a comma (,) between them:
ex:  S3_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME=192.168.122.128:443,192.168.122.129:443,192.168.122.130:443

To control multipart uploads, add the resource variables "S3_MPU_CHUNK" and "S3_MPU_THREADS" to the creation line.
* S3_MPU_CHUNK is the size of each part to be uploaded in parallel (in MB, default is 5MB).  Objects smaller than this will be uploaded with standard PUTs.
* S3_MPU_THREADS is the number of parts to upload in parallel (only under Linux, default is 10).  On non-Linux OSes, this parameter is ignored and multipart uploads are performed sequentially.
