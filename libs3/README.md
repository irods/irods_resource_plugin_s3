This directory contains code from the libs3 library originally written by [Bryan Ischo](https://github.com/bji).

The [original libs3 project](https://github.com/bji/libs3) has been [more-or-less abandoned](https://github.com/bji/libs3/pull/70#issuecomment-414755533) and as of November 2023, the [last upstream commit](https://github.com/bji/libs3/commit/287e4bee6fd430ffb52604049de80a27a77ff6b4) was in April 2019. For a time, iRODS maintained [its own fork](https://github.com/irods/libs3) for use with the S3 resource plugin. However, given that it seems unlikely that Ischo will resume development or maintenance of the library, the decision was made to absorb the libs3 code into the S3 resource plugin repository to ease maintenance. At time of absorption, the [last commit in the iRODS-maintained fork](https://github.com/irods/libs3/commit/e8457e0905dd9e502416b9c6400762ab440bb29e) is dated August 2023.
